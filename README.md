Introduction- <br/>
An online auction system is a web-based platform that enables individuals and businesses to buy and sell goods and services through a bidding process. Unlike traditional auctions where buyers and sellers are physically present at a specific location, online auctions can be conducted from anywhere in the world, making it a convenient and efficient way to transact business.
Online auction systems typically provide a user-friendly interface where participants can browse and search for items, view item descriptions and photos, place bids, and track the progress of auctions in real-time.
