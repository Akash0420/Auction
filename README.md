Introduction- 
An online auction system is a web-based platform that enables individuals and businesses to buy and sell goods and services through a bidding process. Unlike traditional auctions where buyers and sellers are physically present at a specific location, online auctions can be conducted from anywhere in the world, making it a convenient and efficient way to transact business.
Online auction systems typically provide a user-friendly interface where participants can browse and search for items, view item descriptions and photos, place bids, and track the progress of auctions in real-time.

The problem with public auction is that the participation of the general public is very limited. The aim of the project is to socialize the auction so that people from far & wide and even across the continent can participate in it. The “Online Auction” site is developed with a vision to wipe out the inherent problems of “Conventional Auction House”. 
The salient features of the site are as follows:
Paperless Auction System.
It’s accessible to everyone, at any time no matter where they are.
Reliable user validation & checking.
Easy online settlement.
